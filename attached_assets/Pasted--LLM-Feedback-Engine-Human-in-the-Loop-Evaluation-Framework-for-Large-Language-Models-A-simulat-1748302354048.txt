🧠 LLM Feedback Engine
Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models
🔧 A simulation of real-world AI Tutor workflows, built for xAI alignment

📌 Overview
LLM Feedback Engine is a hands-on simulation platform designed to reflect the exact expectations of the AI Tutor role at xAI. This tool enables human evaluators to review, analyze, and provide structured feedback on outputs from large language models (LLMs) — replicating how human insight refines AI alignment, safety, and reasoning.

Built with xAI’s mission in mind — to help AI systems understand the universe — this project focuses on the critical interface between human reasoning and machine learning by showcasing how evaluators guide models through thoughtful, high-quality feedback.

🎯 Core Capabilities
📝 Prompt & Response Evaluation
Input a model-generated response and assess it across key criteria:

Helpfulness

Correctness

Coherence

Empathy & Tone

Safety & Harmfulness Risk

✍️ Structured Human Feedback
Provide in-depth evaluator notes explaining judgments, flagging hallucinations, suggesting improvements, and identifying ethical issues.

📊 Annotation Dashboard
Interactive UI for real-time human annotation of LLM outputs using a clean, multi-metric interface.

📄 Session Summary Export
Generate and export a professional feedback report in Markdown or PDF — similar to internal tooling used in real-world AI alignment workflows.

🌐 Multilingual Prompt Simulation (optional)
Test model responses in languages like Spanish, Hindi, and Arabic to evaluate cultural alignment and translation fidelity.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Flask (Python backend)

HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Frontend)

SQLite (Optional for session storage)

Markdown-to-PDF Conversion for feedback export

Tailwind CSS (optional for design polish)

🧪 Use Case Simulation
This project replicates real-world annotation scenarios used to train and align models like Grok at xAI. Sample use cases include:

Evaluating emotionally sensitive conversations

Detecting factual inaccuracies or hallucinations

Annotating tone and intent in multilingual prompts

Providing corrective feedback on offensive, biased, or misleading responses

Scoring LLMs on safety and reliability under ambiguity
